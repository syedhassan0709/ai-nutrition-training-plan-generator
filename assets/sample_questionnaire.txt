**Describe your health and fitness goals in detail:**
I want to lose about 15 pounds while building lean muscle mass. I've been moderately active but want to be more consistent with both exercise and nutrition. My main challenge is finding time for meal preparation and staying motivated during busy work periods.

**Medical Conditions or Concerns:**
No major medical conditions. Occasional lower back stiffness from desk work.

**Exercise History:**
I played sports in college but have been mostly doing recreational activities like hiking and occasional gym visits for the past 5 years. I'm comfortable with basic exercises but would like more structured guidance.

**Food Preferences and Dislikes:**
I enjoy Mediterranean foods, lean proteins, and vegetables. I'm not a big fan of processed foods and prefer home-cooked meals when possible. I need help with portion control and meal timing.

**Additional Notes:**
I travel for work about once a month, so I need flexible plans that can adapt to different schedules and limited equipment situations. I'm very motivated to make lasting changes this time.
